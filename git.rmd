# Git and github {#git}

If you're serious about software development, the most important tool to learn is git. Git is a software tool revision management tool which allows you to track changes to your code and share those changes with others. Git is most useful when combined with [github](http://github.com), a website that allows you to share your code with the world, solicit code improvements (pull requests) and track issues.

You can do many of the same things with other tools (like svn or bazaar or mercurial) and other websites (like gitlab and bitbucket). But I think git and github is the friendliest system for new developers, not least because it's the most popular, which means every possible problem has already been asked and answered on StackOverflow. 

Why use git and github?

  * Do you have a directory full of files like `my-script.R`, `my-script-1.R`,
    `myscript-2-I-really-hope-this-works.R`, `myscript-FINALLY.R` and so on?
    Git takes care of managing multiple versions of your code so that you
    can easily see what's change, and revert any mistakes that you've made.
    (But note that git isn't a substitute for a backup sytem, you should be
    use git with your backups, not instead of).

  * It makes it easy for other people to install your package. Any R user can 
    get your package with at most two lines of code:
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("username/packagename")
    ```
    
    (The first line isn't necesary if they already have devtools installed.)
    
  * Not only can other people use your code, they can also suggest improvements 
    with pull requests, patches to your code that fixb bugs or implement new
    functionality. Once you've experienced your first pull request, you'll
    never want to go back to developing code any other way.
    
  * Github makes it possible to collaboratively code a package with other 
    people. As long as you're working on different parts of the file,
    git can figure out how to combine your changes. If you are working on
    the same part of the file, git provides tools to help you choose
    between the conflicting changes.

  * Track issues (bugs and feature requests) in one central location. You
    can discuss the problem and propose solutions. When you resolve an 
    issue you can connect it to the exact change that solved the problem,
    which is very useful when you come back to it in the future.

At first, working in the open seems a little scary. Do you really want the whole world seeing your crappy code? Don't worry, nobody is judging you - everybody rights bad code at some point in their lives, and most people are more interested in helping you write better code than making fun of your existing efforts. Once you get used to it, you'll find that coding in the open is tremendously empowering as it helps other people help you.

This chapter describes git and github together, making no attempt to separate the features of each. The goal is to give you the absolute minimum you need to know to use git for an R package. After reading this chapter and working with git for a while, it's highly likely that you'll want to learn more. Some good resource are:
  
* If you'd like to practice using git from the command line, try 
  <https://try.github.io>. It steps you through a number of challenges in
  a virtual shell.

* Github help, <https://help.github.com>, not only teaches you about
  github, but also has good tutorials on many git features.

* If you'd like to learn more about the details of git, read 
  [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.

What you won't learn here:

* branching
* any history modifying changes like (`git rebase` or `git pull --rebase`).

StackOverflow is a vital part of git - when you have a problem that you don't know how to solve, SO should be your first resource. It's highly likely that some one has had exactly the same problem as you, and there will be a variety of approaches to choose from.

RStudio provides many tools to make your day-to-day use of git as easy as possible. However, there are a huge number of git commands, and they're not at all available in the IDE. That means you'll need to run a handful of commands from a shell (aka a console), especially when you're setting up, dealing with merge conflicts and getting out of jams. The easiest way to get to a shell is Tools > Shell. It's also important to be familiar with using git from the command line because if you're searching for problems, you'll need to know what the standard commands are.

## Initial set up {#git-init}

If you've never used git or github before, you'll need to do a little initial setup:

1.  Install git:

    * Windows: <http://msysgit.github.io/>.
    * OS X: <http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/>.
    * Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install git-core`.

1.  Tell git your name and email address. These are used to label each commit
    so that when you start collaborating with others, it's clear who made 
    each change. In a shell, run:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "<YOUR NAME>"
    git config --global user.email "<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>"
    ```

1.  Create a free account on github: <https://github.com>. Use the same
    name and email address as the previous step.
    
1.  If needed, generate ssh keys. You can check if you have an ssh key
    already by running:
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    file.exists("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
    ```

    If it's `FALSE`, you'll need to create one. You can follow the [github 
    instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) or
    use RStudio. Go to RStudio preferences, choose the Git/SVN panel, then 
    click "Create RSA key...":
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-config.png", dpi = 220)
    ```
    
1.  Add your public key to <https://github.com/settings/ssh>. The
    easiest way to get the key is to click "View public key" in the
    Git/SVN preferences pane (as shown above).

## Create a local git repository

Now that you have git installed and configured, you need to initialise a local git repository for your package. This repository (repo for short) exists only on your computer. This is different to old systems like svn which were always connected to a central server. Git makes a clear distinction between local and remote repos; you mostly work locally then push your changes to a remote repo when you're ready to share your work with others.

There are two ways to create a new git repo:

  * In RStudio, go to project options, then the Git/SVN panel. Change the 
    "Version control system" from "None" to "Git":
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-proj-config.png", dpi = 220)
    ```
    
    You'll then be prompted to restart RStudio.

  * In a shell, run `git init`. Restart RStudio and reopen your package.

Once git has been activated in a project, you'll see two new components in the IDE:

  * The git pane, which is shown the top-right (by default). It shows you what
    files have changed since you last committed, and exposes the most important
    git commands as buttons.
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-pane.png", dpi = 220)
    ```
    
  * The git dropdown in the toolbar. This exposes git and github commands
    useful for working with the current file:
  
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-dropdown.png", dpi = 220)
    ```

With the repository set up, you can now:

* See what you've changed: [git status](#git-status).
* Add and commit files: [git commit](#git-commit).
* Undo mistakes: [undo](#git-undo)

To get more out of git, you'll need to connect your repo with github:

* [initialising github](#github-init)
* [cloning a repo](#git-clone)
* working with others, [`git pull`](#git-pull)
* review history, [`git log`](#git-log)

## See what's changed {#git-status}

The RStudio git pane shows, at a glance, what's changed. Each added, modified or deleted file is listed, along with an icon summarising the change:

* `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-modified.png", dpi = 220)`, 
  __Modified__. You've changed the contents of the file.

* `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-unknown.png", dpi = 220)`, 
  __Untracked__. You've added a new file that git hasn't seen before.

* `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-deleted.png", dpi = 220)`, 
  __Deleted__. You've deleted a file.
  
You can get the same information (in a slightly different format) in the shell by running `git status`. 

For text files, you can get more details about modifications a "diff", `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-diff.png", dpi = 220)`. This opens a new window showing the detailed **diff**erences:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-diff-window.png")
```

Red blocks show removed text and green blocks show added text. Context, lines surrounding the change, are shown in grey, and help you to place the change in the context of complete file. You can get a similar display in the shell by running `git diff`. 

## Add and commit files {#git-commit}

The fundamental unit of work in git is a __commit__. A commit is a snapshot of the state of your code at a fixed point in time. You can think of a commit as a set of changes: what files did you add, edit and delete? Committing code is the most common git operation. You'll create many commits each day. A commit is made up of:

* A unique identifier called a sha.

* A human-readable commit message.

* A parent, the change that came before this one. (Commits can have multiple
  parents, as you'll learn in XYZ)

* A changeset describing what files were added, modified and changed.

Commit can be a confusing word because it's used in two senses: 

* As a noun: a commit is a snapshot of your code.
* As a verb: commit your changes to create a new snapshot.

I'll try to avoid confusing sentences like you commit code to create a commit.

Creating a commmit occurs in two stages:

1.  You __stage__ files, telling git that you want to include them in the
    next commit. In the shell you use `git add` for new and modified files,
    and `git rm` for deleted files. 
  
1.  You __commit__ the staged files, describe the changes with a message.
    In the shell you use `git commit`.

You perform both these steps in the same place in RStudio: the commit window. Open the commit window by clicking `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-commit.png", dpi = 220)`, or by pressing Ctrl + Alt + m. Here's a screenshot I took while writing this chapter:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-commit-window.png", dpi = 220)
```

There are three panes:

* The top-left pane shows the current status, the same as the git pane in the 
  main RStudio window.

* The bottom pane shows the changes made (the "diff") in the file currently 
  selected in the status pane.

* The top-right pane is where you'll enter the commit message, a human 
  readable message summarising the changes made in the commit. More on 
  that shortly.

(Yes, this is exactly the same window you see when clicking `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-diff.png", dpi = 220)`!)

To make a new commit:

1.  __Save your changes__.

1.  __Open the commit window__ by clicking 
    `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-commit.png", dpi = 220)` or 
    pressing `Ctrl + Alt + M`.  

1.  __Stage files to be included in the next commit__.  To stage a single 
    file, tick the corresponding check box. To stage all files, press Cmd + A, 
    then click `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-stage.png", dpi = 220)`. 
    
    As you stage each file, you'll notice that its status changes. There are two 
    columns: staged status on the left and unstaged status on the right. All
    staged change will be included in the next commit.
    
    There are two new statuses that you'll see when staging files:

      * Added: `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-added.png", dpi = 220)`: 
        after staging an untracked file, git now knows that you want to add it 
        to the repo.
      
      * Renamed: `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-renamed.png", dpi = 220)`:
        If you rename a file, git initially sees it as deleting one file and
        adding a new file. Once you stage both changes, git will recognise 
        that it's a rename.
        
    Sometimes you'll see a status in both columns, e.g. 
    `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-modified-staged.png", dpi = 220)`.
    This means that you have both staged unstaged changes in the same file.
    This means that you've made some changes, staged them, and then made some 
    more. Clicking the staged checkbox will stage your new changes, clicking
    it again will unstage both sets of changes.

1.  __Write a commit message__ (top-right panel). The first line of a commit 
    message is called the subject line and should be brief (50 characters or 
    less). For complicated commits, you can follow it with a blank line and 
    then a paragraph or bulleted list providing more detail. Write messages in 
    imperative, like you're telling someone what to do: "fix this bug", not 
    "fixed this bug".
    
1.  __Click Commit__.

### Ignoring files

There are often files that you don't want to include in the repository. They might be transient artefacts (like stuff you get when building latex files, or compiling C code), or they might be too big, or they might be generated on demand. Instead of carefully not-staging them each time, you should add them to `.gitignore` to prevent them from every being added. 

The easiest way to do this is to right-click on the file in the git pane and select `Ignore`. If you want to ignore multiple files, you can use a wildcard "glob" like `*.png`.

Some developers stick to the convention that no files that can be generated from other files should ever be committed into git. For R packages this means the `man/` directory that is autogenerated from R comments. Pragmatically, it's better not to do this because currently R packages have no way to generate `.Rd` files on install, so if you don't check them in and someone installs your package from github they won't have any documentation.

## Commit best practices {#commit-best-practices}

Ideally, each commit should:

* __Minimal__

* __Related__

* __Complete__

And each commit message should:

* __Be concise, yet evocative__.

* __Describe the why, not the what__. You can always retrieve the diff 
  associated with a commit, so the message doesn't need to say exactly what 
  changed. Instead it should provide a high-level summary, and focus on the 
  motivation for the change.

If you do this then:

* It's easier to work with others. If two people have changed the same file
  in the same place, it's easier to resolve the conflict if the commits are
  small and it's clear why each change was made.
  
* Newcomers to the project could easily understand the history by reading 
  the commit logs.
  
* You can load and run your package at any point in its life. This can
  be tremendously useful in conjunction with tools like 
  [bisectr](https://github.com/wch/bisectr), which allow you to use binary
  search to quickly narrow in on the commit that introduced a bug.

* When you discover exactly when you introduced a bug, you can easily 
  understand what you were doing (and why!).

The time you spend on your commits is inversely proportional to the amount of time others will spend understanding the history of your project. This is a less common operation, but it's important if you want to see what's changed or undo a mistake.  Commit messages are most important when you are collaborating with others. You might think that no one else will ever look at your repo, but there is one important collaborator for every project that you do: future-you! Future-you probably has forgotten a lot of things that present-you knows.

Remember that these are aspirations, and you shouldn't let them get in your way.  If you look at the commit history of my repositories, you'll notice a lot of them aren't that great, especially when I start to get frustrated that I __still__ haven't managed to fix a bug.

## Undo a mistake {#git-undo}

The best thing about using commits is that you can undo mistakes. RStudio provides some tools for the most common types of mistake:

* If you made a mistake in a commit, you can modify the previous commit by 
  clicking `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-commit-amend.png", dpi = 220)`. 
  
* If you want undo the changes you've made to a file, right click on it in 
  the git pane and select "revert". Proceed with caution: this is one of the
  few operations that you can't undo.

* You undo changes to parts of a file in the diff window. Look for the
  discard chunk button above the block of changes that you want to undo:
  `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-chunk.png", dpi = 220)`

If one of these doesn't help, don't panic. The chances are that you can recover whatever was lost. Start by making a backup of the directory. Then even if you make a mistake while trying to fix your first mistake, you can start again. To undo more general problems you'll need to use the command line. 

The first step in undoing a mistake is to go back in time and find a good commit. The easiest way to do that is to use the "History" view to find the commit where the mistake occured. Then the __parent__ of that commit will be good. Note the sha (the unique identifier for that commit) of the parent. Then you can:

  * See what the file looked in the paste so you can copy-and paste the old
    code:
    
    ```bash
    git show <sha> <filename>
    ```

  * Copy historical version into the present:

    ```bash
    git checkout <sha> <filename>
    ```
    
In both cases you'll need finish by staging and commiting the files.

(It's also possible to use git as if you went back in time and prevented the mistake from happening in the first place. This is called __rebasing history__ and is an advanced technique. As you can imaging going back in time to change the past can have profound impacts on the present. It can be useful, but needs extreme care.)

If you're still stuck, try <http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html> which provides a step-by-step approach to fixing many other problems.
    
## Synchronising with github {#github-init}

Most of the time you work locally. This is really convenient because you don't need internet access to use git - you can keep on committing changes even when you're on a plane. However, git is most useful in conjunction with github, allowing you to share you code with the world.  

1.  Create a new repo on github: <https://github.com/new>.

1.  In the shell, follow the instructions provided by github. They'll look
    something like this:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin git@github.com:rstudio/ggcomp.git
    git push -u origin master
    ```
  
    This tells git where the "origin" of your repo is, and to send it all the
    changes you've made so far. 
    
    You only need to run these commands once per repo.
  
1.  Add `URL` and `BugReports` fields to your `DESCRIPTION` to links to your 
    new github site. For example, dplyr has:

    ```yaml
    URL: http://github.com/hadley/dplyr
    BugReports: http://github.com/hadley/dplyr/issues
    ```

Now you can __push__ your changes to github by clicking `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-push.png", dpi = 220)`. (This is the same as running `git push` in the shell). 

Pushing your code to github publishes it for the world to use. For that reason, once you've learned about `R CMD check` in [automated checking](#check), it's a good idea to run that before you push. Fix any problems so that you're always publishing good code.

Once you've connected your repo to github, the git pane will show you how many commits you have locally that are not on github: `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-local-commits.png", dpi = 220)`. This message indicates that I have 1 commit locally (my branch) that it not on github ("origin/master").

## Working with others {#git-pull}

So far you've been using push to synchronise your changes with github. The main difference when working with others, is that they're also synchronising their changes to github, so you'll need to get them. You do that with pull.

When you pull, git first downloads (fetches) all of the changes and then merges them with the changes that you've made. A merge is a commit with two parents. It takes two different lines of development and combines them into a single result. To do so, git needs to combine two sets of changes. In many cases it can do so automatically - if the changes are to different files, or even different parts of the same file. However, if the changes are to the same place in a file, you'll need to resolve the changes yourself. This is called a __merge conflict__.

In RStudio, you'll discover that you have merge conflict when:

* Pull fails with an error.

* You get the status 
  `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-commit-conflict.png", dpi = 220)`

RStudio currently doesn't provide any tools to help with merge conflicts, so you'll need to use the command line. I recommend starting by setting your merge conflict "style" to diff3. The diff3 style shows three things when you get a merge conflict: your local changes, the original file and remote changes. The default style is diff2, which only shows your changes and the remote changes, which generally makes it harder to figure out what's happened. 

* If you've encountered your first merge conflict:

    ```bash
    # Abort this merge
    git merge --abort
    # Set the conflict style
    git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
    # Re-try the merge
    git pull
    ```
    
* If you're not in the middle of a merge conflict, just run 

    ```bash
    git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
    ```

To resolve the merge conflict, you need to open every file with the status `r bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-commit-conflict.png", dpi = 220)`. In each file, you'll find a conflict marker that looks like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD

||||||| merged common ancestors

=======

>>>>>>> remote
```

This shows all three versions of the conflicting code:

* At top, the code that you code.
* In the middle, the code from the previous commit. (This is missing in the 
  default merge conflict style, so if you don't see it, follow the instructions
  above).
* At bottom, the code that you're trying to merge in.

You need to work through each conflict block and decide either which version is better, or integrate the changes from each.  Delete the conflict markers, leaving only the new code.  As you fix each file, stage it, and then once you've fixed them all, make a new commit, then push back to github.

Special notes:

* `man/`: don't fix. Resolve the conflicts in the R files that generated them
   and re-document.
   
* `NAMESPACE`: merge conflicts in the `NAMESPACE` file prevent you from 
  re-loading or re-documenting the package. You'll need to resolve them 
  sufficiently that the package can load, then re-document to generate a clean & 
  correct `NAMESPACE`.

If you manage to get totally confused, remember you can always restart from scratch by running `git merge --abort` then `git pull`. Otherwise remember that google and stackoverflow are great resources - processing merge conflicts is one of the trickiest parts of git and there are a lot of tutorials out there. You may need to read a few to really get the hang of it.

## History {#git-log}

* History view.
* Commits on github.
* View on github.
* Blame on github.

## Issues

I recommend that you use them. Don't go too crazy with tags and milestones.

<https://guides.github.com/features/issues/>

Close issues with commit messages: `Close #n`, `@xyz`. etc.

Good idea to add a bullet point to `NEWS.md`. Describe more in user terms. Commit message describes in developer terms.

## Reviewing and accepting pull requests

Add bullet to news. 

<http://sarah.thesharps.us/2014/09/01/the-gentle-art-of-patch-review/>

## Making pull requests

### Retrieve a repo from github {#git-clone}

Creating a local copy of a remote repo is called __cloning__. You can do it from the shell with `git clone`, or use RStudio.  If you want 

1.  Go to the github page and determine the git repo url. It's shown
    in the right-hand sidebar:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-clone-github.png", dpi = 220)
    ```
    
    I recommend using the ssh url (by clicking SSH). Click the copy button
    to put the url on your clipboard.
    
1.  Create a new project in RStudio:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-clone-1.png", dpi = 220)
    bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-clone-2.png", dpi = 220)
    ```
    
1.  Paste the repo url:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    bookdown::embed_png("screenshots/git-clone-3.png", dpi = 220)
    ```

    (Here I'm cloning the repo for this book.)

### Making

Good commit messages are most important when you're submitting a pull request, sharing your changes with someone else. You want to make life as easy as possible for them, so that they can easily see what you've done, decreasing the amount of work they have to do and increasing the chances that your pull request will be accepted.

* Strive to make as clean as possible.
* Branch

There are more advanced history modifying features available from the command
line. See [rewriting history](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)
for details.
