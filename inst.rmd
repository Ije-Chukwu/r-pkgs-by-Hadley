# Installed files {#inst}

When a package is installed, everything in `inst/` is copied to the installed directory. In some sense `inst/` is the opposite of `.Rbuildignore` - where`.Rbuildignore` lets you remove arbitrary files and directories from the top-level, `inst/` lets you add them. You are free to put anything you like in `inst/` with one exception: because `inst/` is copied to the top-level directory, you should never use a subdirectory with the same name as an existing directory. This means that you should avoid `inst/build`, `inst/data`, `inst/demo`, `inst/exec`, `inst/help`, `inst/html`, `inst/inst`, `inst/libs`, `inst/Meta`, `inst/man`, `inst/po`, `inst/R`, `inst/src`, `inst/tests`, `inst/tools` and `inst/vignettes`.

This chapter discusses the most common files found in `inst/`:

* `inst/AUTHOR` and `inst/COPYRIGHT`. If the copyright and authorship of a 
  package is particularly complex, you can use plain text files, 
  `inst/COPYRIGHTS` and `inst/AUTHORS`, to provide more information.

* `inst/CITATION`: description of how to cite the package, see 
  [package citation](#inst-citation) for details.

* `inst/docs`: an older convention for the location of vignettes.
  It should be avoided in modern packages.

* `inst/extdata`: location for additional external data for examples and 
  vignettes. See [external data](#data-extdata) for more details.

* `inst/java`, `inst/python` etc. See [other languages](#inst-other-langs).

To find a file in `inst/` with R code, use `system.file()`. For example, to find `inst/extdata/mydata.csv`, you'd call `system.file("extdata", "mydata.csv", package = "mypackage")`. Note that you omit the `inst/` directory from the path. This will work if the package is installed, or if it's been loaded with `devtools::load_all()`.

## Package citation {#inst-citation}

The `CITATION` file lives in the `inst` directory and is linked to the `citation()` function which tells you how to cite R and R packages. Calling `citation()` without any arguments tells you how to cite base R:

```{r}
citation()
```

Calling it with a package name tells you how to cite that package:

```{r}
citation("lubridate")
```

To customise the citation of your package, add a `inst/CITATION` file. It'll looks like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
citation <- readLines(system.file("CITATION", package = "lubridate"))
cat(citation, sep = "\n")
```

You need to create `inst/CITATION`. As you can see, it's pretty simple: you only need to learn one new function, `citEntry()`. The most important arguments are:

* `entry`: the type of citation, "Article", "Book", "PhD Thesis" etc.

* The standard bibliographic information like `title`, `author` (which should 
  be a `personList()`), `year`, `journal`, `volume`, `issue`, `pages`, ...
  
A complete list of arguments can be found in `?bibentry`.

Use `citHeader()` and `citFooter()` to add additional exhortations.

## Other languages {#inst-other-langs}

Sometimes a package contains useful supplementary scripts in other programming languages. Generally, you should avoid this because it adds an additional dependency. But it may be useful when wrapping substantial amounts of code from another language. For example, [gdata](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gdata/index.html)wraps the Perl module [Spreadsheet::ParseExcel](http://search.cpan.org/~dougw/Spreadsheet-ParseExcel-0.65/) that allows you to read Excel files into R.

The convention is to put scripts of this nature into a subdirectory of `inst/`, `inst/python`, `inst/perl`, `inst/ruby` etc. If these scripts are essential to your package, make sure you also add the appropriate programming language to the `SystemRequirements` field in the `DESCRIPTION`. (This field is for human reading so don't worry about exactly how you specify it.)

Java is a special case because you need to include both the source code (it should go in `java/` and be listed in `.Rinstignore`), and the compiled jar files (they should go in `inst/java`). Make sure to add `rJava` to `Imports`.
