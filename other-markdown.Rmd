# Other markdown files {#important-files}

You now have a package that's ready to submit to CRAN.
But before you do, there are two important files that you should update: `README.md` which describes what the package does, and `NEWS.md` which describes what's changed since the previous version.
I recommend using Markdown for these files, because it's useful for them to be readable as both plain text (e.g. in emails) and HTML (e.g. on GitHub, in blog posts).
The basic writing and formatting syntax is available at <https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/>.

## README

### README.md {#readme-md}

The goal of the `README.md` is to answer the following questions about your package:

-   Why should I use it?
-   How do I use it?
-   How do I get it?

On GitHub, the `README.md` will be rendered as HTML and displayed on the repository home page.

I normally structure my `README` as follows:

1.  A paragraph that describes the high-level purpose of the package.

2.  An example that shows how to use the package to solve a simple problem.

3.  Installation instructions, giving code that can be copied and pasted into R.

4.  An overview that describes the main components of the package.
    For more complex packages, this will point to vignettes for more details.

### README.Rmd {#readme-rmd}

If you include an example in your `README` (a good idea!) you may want to generate it with R Markdown.
The easiest way to get started is to use `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`.
This creates a template `README.Rmd` and adds it to `.Rbuildignore`.
The template looks like:

    ---
    output: github_document
    ---

    <!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

    `​``{r, echo = FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(
      collapse = TRUE,
      comment = "#>",
      fig.path = "README-"
    )
    `​``

This:

-   Outputs Github flavoured Markdown.

-   Includes a comment in `README.md` to remind you to edit `README.Rmd`, not `README.md`.

-   Sets up my recommended knitr options, including saving an image to `README-chunkname.png` (which is automatically `.Rbuildignore`d.)

You'll need to remember to re-knit `README.Rmd` each time you modify it.
If you use git, `use_readme_rmd()` automatically adds the following "pre-commit" hook:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
if [[ README.Rmd -nt README.md ]]; then
  echo "README.md is out of date; please re-knit README.Rmd"
  exit 1
fi 
```

This prevents `git commit` from succeeding unless `README.md` is more recent than `README.Rmd`.
If you get a false positive, you can ignore the check with `git commit --no-verify`.
Note that git commit hooks are not stored in the repository, so every time you clone the repo, you'll need to run `usethis::use_readme_rmd()` to set it up again.

## NEWS.md {#news}

The `README.md` is aimed at new users.
The `NEWS.md` is aimed at existing users: it should list all the API changes in each release.
There are a number of formats you can use for package news, but I recommend `NEWS.md`.
It's well supported by GitHub, permitted by CRAN, and is easy to re-purpose for other formats.

Organise your `NEWS.md` as follows:

-   Use a top-level heading for each version: e.g. `# mypackage 1.0`.
    The most recent version should go at the top.

-   Each change should be included in a bulleted list.
    If you have a lot of changes you might want to break them up using subheadings, `## Major changes`, `## Bug fixes` etc.
    I usually stick with a simple list until just before releasing the package when I'll reorganise into sections, if needed.
    It's hard to know in advance exactly what sections you'll need.

-   If an item is related to an issue in GitHub, include the issue number in parentheses, e.g. `(#​10)`.
    If an item is related to a pull request, include the pull request number and the author, e.g. `(#​101, @hadley)`.
    Doing this makes it easy to navigate to the relevant issues on GitHub.

The main challenge with `NEWS.md` is getting into the habit of noting a change as you make a change.
