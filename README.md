This repo holds the code and text behind the **R Packages** book.
The site is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

-   The first edition is no longer available online.
-   A second edition is under development and available at <https://r-pkgs.org>.

*Status as of 2022-07: Work on a second edition is full swing, with publication expected in early 2023. Issues and PRs are welcome, but please bear in mind that sometimes we need to make large, systematic changes ourselves, which can clobber smaller, external PRs.*

## Notes on mechanics

Screenshots: use `include_graphics()`, chunk should have `output.width = NULL`.
