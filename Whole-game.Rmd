# The Whole Game {#whole-game}

## do we build the toy package? if so, where?
## * NA            --> no, don't build it

```

*Spoiler alert!*

This chapter runs through the development of a small toy package, from beginning to end. It's meant to paint the Big Picture and suggest the workflow, before we descend into the detailed treatment of the key components of an R package.

To keep the pace brisk, we exploit many of the modern conveniences in the devtools package and the RStudio IDE. In later chapters, we are more explicit about what those helpers are doing for us.

*Work in progress! Adapting from material originally developed as part of STAT 545 and as a possible vignette for devtools.*

## Load devtools and friends

Load the devtools package. We also load the usethis package explicitly. It is one of the packages that power devtools (FIXME: link to material on the conscious uncoupling of devtools) and we'll use some usethis functions that aren't exposed by devtools.

```{r}
library(devtools)
library(usethis)
```

For presentation purposes only, we'll use [fs](https://fs.r-lib.org), for filesystem work, and the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org), for light data wrangling.

```{r, R.options = list(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)}
library(tidyverse)
library(fs)
```

## Toy package: foofactors

We use multiple functions from devtools to build a small toy package from scratch, with features commonly seen in released packages:

  * Developed under version control (Git, in this case) and in the open (GitHub, in this case). *optional, but shown*
  * Documentation for individual functions, using convenience functions in devtools that call [roxygen2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=roxygen2).
  * Unit testing, using convenience functions in devtools to exploit [testthat](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat).
  * Documentation for the package as a whole, via a package-level help file, a vignette, and an executable `README.Rmd`.

We call the package **foofactors** and it will consist of a couple functions for handling factors. Please note that these functions are super simple and definitely not the point! For a proper package for factor handling, please see [forcats](https://cran.r-project.org/package=forcats).

The foofactors package itself is not our goal here. It is a device for demonstrating a typical workflow for package development with devtools.

## Peek at the finished product

The foofactors package is tracked during its development with the Git version control system. This is purely optional and you can certainly follow along without implementing this. A nice side benefit is that we eventually connect it to a remote repository on GitHub, which means you can see the glorious result we are working towards by visiting foofactors on GitHub: <https://github.com/jennybc/foofactors>. By inspecting the [commit history](https://github.com/jennybc/foofactors/commits/master) and especially the diffs, you can see exactly what changes at each step of the process laid out below.

**QUESTION: I think these diffs are extremely useful and would like to surface them better here.**

## `create_package()`

Call `create_package()` to initialize a new package in a directory on your computer (and create the directory, if necessary).

Make a deliberate choice about where to create this package on your computer. It should probably be somewhere within your home directory, alongside your other R projects. It should not be nested inside another RStudio Project, R package, or Git repo. Nor should it be in an R package library, which holds packages that have already been built and installed. The conversion of the source package we are creating here into an installed package is part of what devtools facilitates. Don't try to do devtools' job for it!

Substitute your chosen path into a `create_package()` call like this:

```{r create-package-fake, eval = FALSE}
create_package("~/path/to/foofactors")
```

We have to work in a temp directory, because this book is built non-interactively, in the cloud. Behind the scenes, we're executing our own `create_package()` command, but don't be surprised if our output differs a bit from yours.

```{r configure, include = FALSE}
where <- match.arg(where, choices = c(NA, "tmp_user", "tmp_session"))
create <- !is.na(where)

where <- switch(
  where,
  tmp_user = fs::path_home("tmp"),
  tmp_session = fs::path_temp(),
  NULL
)

foopath <- path(where, "foofactors")

if (!is.null(where)) {
  if (fs::dir_exists(foopath)) {
    fs::dir_delete(foopath)
  }
  fs::dir_create(where)
}
```

```{r create-package, include = debug, eval = create, echo = debug, R.options = list(usethis.description = NULL)}
create_package(foopath, open = FALSE, rstudio = TRUE)
proj_set(foopath)
```

```{r set-proj-and-wd, include = debug, eval = create}
# being kind to the vignette developer
(owd <- getwd()) 
if (is.null(getOption("knitr.in.progress"))) {
  setwd(foopath)
  Sys.setenv(TESTTHAT = "true")
}
getwd()

## I normally am not this masochistic, but there is little choice
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = foopath)
```

```{r sitrep, include = debug, eval = create}
## can't be in chunk above, because knitr
proj_sitrep()
```

If you're working in RStudio, you should find yourself in a new instance of RStudio, opened into your new foofactors package (and Project). If you somehow need to do this manually, navigate to the directory and double click on `foofactors.Rproj`. RStudio has special handling for packages and you should now see a *Build* tab in the same pane as *Environment* and *History*.

*good place for a screenshot*

What's in this new directory that is also an R package and, probably, an RStudio Project? Here's a listing (locally, you can consult your Files pane):

```{r init-show-files, echo = FALSE, eval = create}
dir_info(all = TRUE) %>% 
  select(path, type)
```

  * `.Rbuildignore` lists files that we need to have around but that should not be included when building the R package from source.
  * `.Rproj.user`, if you have it, is a directory used internally by RStudio.
  * `.gitignore` anticipates Git usage and ignores some standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio. Even if you do not plan to use Git, this is harmless.
  * `DESCRIPTION` provides [metadata about your package](#description). We edit this shortly.
  * [`NAMESPACE`](#namespace) declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages. At the moment, it holds temporary-yet-functional placeholder content.
  * The `R/` directory is the ["business end" of your package](#r). It will soon contain `.R` files with function definitions.
  * `foofactors.Rproj` is the file that makes this directory an RStudio Project. Even if you don't use RStudio, this file is harmless. Or you can suppress its creation with `create_package(..., rstudio = FALSE)`.

## `use_git()`

*This is optional, but a recommended practice in the long-term. If you don't use Git, simply ignore this and subsequent instructions related to version control.*

The foofactors directory is an R source package and an RStudio Project. Now we make it also a Git repository, with `devtools::use_git()`.

```{r use-git, eval = create, chunk_envvar = c("TESTTHAT" = "true")}
use_git()  
```

In an interactive session, you will be asked if you want to commit some files here and you should probably accept the offer. Behind the scenes, we'll cause the same to happen for us.

```{r git2r-begin, echo = debug, eval = create}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(git2r))
repo <- repository(proj_get())
paths <- unlist(status(repo), use.names = FALSE)
add(repo, paths)
commit(repo, "Initial commit")
```

What's new? Only the creation of a `.git` directory, which is hidden in most contexts, including the RStudio file browser. Its existence is evidence that we have indeed initialized a Git repo here.

```{r post-git-file-list, echo = FALSE, eval = create}
dir_info(all = TRUE, regexp = "^[.]git$") %>% 
  select(path, type)
```

If you're using RStudio, it probably requested permission to relaunch itself in this Project. You can do so manually by quitting and relaunching by double clicking on `foofactors.Rproj`. Now, in addition to package development support, you have access to a basic Git client in the *Git* tab of the *Environment/History/Build* pane.

*good place for a screenshot*

Click on History (the clock icon) and, if you consented, you might see an initial commit made via `use_git()`:

```{r inspect-first-commit, echo = FALSE, eval = create}
commits(repo)[[1]]
```

FYI RStudio can initialize a Git repository, in any Project, even if it's not an R package: *Tools > Version Control > Project Setup*. Then choose *Version control system: Git* and *initialize a new git repository for this project*.

## Write the first function

It is not too hard to find a puzzling operation involving factors. Let's see what happens when we catenate two factors.

```{r}
(a <- factor(c("character", "hits", "your", "eyeballs")))
(b <- factor(c("but", "integer", "where it", "counts")))
c(a, b)
```

Huh? Many people do not expect the result of catenating two factors to be an integer vector consisting of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. What if we coerce each factor to character, catenate, then re-convert to factor?

```{r}
factor(c(as.character(a), as.character(b)))
```

Here's `fbind()`, a function that puts this logic into a function:

```{r fbind-fodder, asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
fbind_fodder <- c(
  "fbind <- function(a, b) {",
  "  factor(c(as.character(a), as.character(b)))",
  "}"
)
cat(fbind_fodder, sep = "\n")
```

## `use_r()`

Where shall we define `fbind()`? Save it in a `.R` file, in the `R/` subdirectory of your package. A reasonable default is to make a new `.R` file for each function in your package and name the file after the function. So we'll save the definition of of `fbind()` in the file `R/fbind.R`.

The helper `use_r()` creates and/or opens a script below `R/`. It really shines in a more mature package, when navigating between `.R` files and the associated tests. But, even here, it's useful to keep yourself from getting too carried away while working in `Untitled4`.

```{r init-fbind, eval = create, chunk_envvar = c("TESTTHAT" = "true")}
use_r("fbind")
```

```{r write-fbind, include = FALSE, eval = create}
writeLines(fbind_fodder, path("R", "fbind.R"))
```

Put the definition of `fbind()` **and only the definition of `fbind()`** in `R/fbind.R` and save it. The file `R/fbind.R` should NOT contain any of the other top-level code we have recently executed, such as the definitions of factors `a` and `b`, `library(devtools)` or `use_git()`. This foreshadows an adjustment you'll need to make as you transition from writing R scripts to R packages. Packages and scripts use different mechanisms to declare their dependency on other packages and to store example or test code. We explore this further in chapter \@ref(r).

## `load_all()`

How do we test drive `fbind()`? If this were a regular R script, we might use RStudio to send the function definition to the R Console and define `fbind()` in the global workspace. Or maybe we'd call `source("R/fbind.R")`. For package development, however, devtools offers a more robust approach.

Call `devtools::load_all()` to make `fbind()` available for experimentation.

```{r load-all, eval = create}
load_all()
```

Now call `fbind(a, b)` to see how it works.

```{r, eval = create}
fbind(a, b)
```

Note that `load_all()` has made the `fbind()` function available, although it does not exist in the global workspace.

```{r, eval = create}
exists("fbind", where = ".GlobalEnv", inherits = FALSE)
```

`load_all()` simulates the process of building, installing, and attaching the foofactors package. As your package accumulates more functions, some exported, some not, some of which call each other, `load_all()` gives you a much more accurate sense of how the package is developing than test driving functions defined in the global workspace. Also `load_all()` allows much faster iteration than actually building, installing, and attaching the package.

Review so far:

  * We wrote our first function, `fbind()`, to catenate two factors.
  * We used `load_all()` to quickly make this function available for interactive use, as if we'd built and installed foofactors and attached it via `library(foofactors)`.

You may want to learn the RStudio keyboard and menu shortcuts for `load_all()`:

  * Windows & Linux: Ctrl + Shift + L
  * Mac: Cmd + Shift + L
  * In *Environment/History/Build/Git* pane:
    - *Build > More > Load All*
  * From Build menu:
    - *Build > Load All*

### Commit `fbind()`

If you're using Git, use your preferred method to commit the new `R/fbind.R` file. We do so behind the scenes here and here's the associated diff.

```{r fbind-commit, echo = debug, comment = NA, include = FALSE, eval = create}
add(repo, path = path("R", "fbind.R"))
commit(repo, message = "Add fbind()")
## tags might be useful for making stable links to the package at specific
## evolutionary stages
## possible convention: tag name = chunk label
#tag_name <- knitr::opts_current$get("label")
#tag(repo, tag_name, "initial creation of fbind()")
#tag(repo, "fbind-init", "initial creation of fbind()")
#sha <- (commits(repo)[[1]])@sha
```

```{r add-fbind-diff, echo = FALSE, eval = create, asis = TRUE}
commits(repo)[[1]]
tree_1 <- tree(commits(repo)[[2]])
tree_2 <- tree(commits(repo)[[1]])
cat(diff(tree_1, tree_2, as_char = TRUE))
```

From this point on, we commit after each step. Remember [these commits](https://github.com/jennybc/foofactors/commits/master) are available in the public repository.

## `check()`

We have solid evidence that `fbind()` works. But how can we be sure that all the moving parts of the package still work? This may seem silly to check, after such a small addition, but it's good to establish the habit of checking this often.

How do we move our local source package through the necessary stages to get it properly installed?

```{r pkg-installation-diagram, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/installation.png")
```

### Base utilities

devtools wraps the base utilities for package management, but in a way favorable for very quick iteration. Under the hood, here are the important commands:

  * [`R CMD build`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/utils/html/PkgUtils.html) converts a source package to a bundle or tarball
  * [`R CMD INSTALL`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/utils/html/INSTALL.html) installs a package bundle into a library
  * [`R CMD check`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/utils/html/PkgUtils.html) runs all sorts of checks. Even if you don't plan to submit your package to CRAN, it's a very good idea to make this part of your own quality standard.

In a shell, with working directory set to the parent of foofactors, here's what usage might look like:

``` bash
R CMD build foofactors
R CMD check foofactors_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz
R CMD INSTALL foofactors_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz
```

### devtools and RStudio

Luckily devtools and RStudio make these utilities very easy to access without going to the shell.

At intermediate milestones, you should check your package:

  * In R Console
    - `devtools::check()`
  * From RStudio's *Build* pane:
    - *Check*
    - *More > Check package*
    - Windows & Linux: Ctrl + Shift + E (*check this*)
    - Mac: Cmd + Shift + E

**Just this once, run `check()` with `document = FALSE`**, so we don't get ahead of ourselves. Specifically, I don't want to mess with our `NAMESPACE` file yet.

```{r check-no-document-fake, eval = FALSE}
check(document = FALSE)
```

```{r check-no-document, eval = create, warning = TRUE}
check(proj_get(), document = FALSE, error_on = "never")
```

**Read the output of the check!** Deal with problems early and often. It's just like incremental development of `.R` and `.Rmd`. The longer you go between full checks that everything works, the harder it is to pinpoint and solve your problems.

At this point, we expect 2 warnings (and 0 errors, 0 notes):

  * `Non-standard license specification`
  * `Undocumented code objects: 'fbind'`

We'll address both soon.

## `install()`

Since we've already made respectable interim progress, let's install the foofactors package into your library via `devtools::install()`:

```{r first-install-fake, eval = FALSE}
install()
```

```{r first-install, install = FALSE, eval = create}
install(proj_get())
```

Now we can attach and use foofactors like any other package.

A shortcut for "build, install, and reload" is offered in the RStudio Build pane:

  * *Build > Build & Reload*

Now that we've installed foofactors properly, let's revisit our small example from the top. This is a good time to restart your R session and ensure you have a clean workspace.

```{r, eval = create}
library(foofactors)
a <- factor(c("character", "hits", "your", "eyeballs"))
b <- factor(c("but", "integer", "where it", "counts"))
fbind(a, b)
```

Success!

## Edit `DESCRIPTION`

Before we tackle the warnings about the license and documentation, let's replace the boilerplate content in `DESCRIPTION`. The `DESCRIPTION` file provides metadata about your package:

  * Full coverage is in [Package metadata](#description).
  * Read more from [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file)

Make these edits:

  * Make yourself the author.
  * Write some descriptive text in the `Title` and `Description` fields. Note that CRAN is very particular about these fields, so if you want to keep passing `check()`, there is deeper coverage [later in this book](#pkg-description).

When you're done, `DESCRIPTION` should look similar to this:

**QUESTION: maybe I should be using desc here? Or is there a way to achieve what I want throught the usethis API?**

```{r description-fodder, asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA, eval = create}
DESCRIPTION_fodder <- c(
  "Package: foofactors",
  "Title: Make Factors Less Annoying",
  "Version: 0.0.0.9000",
  "Authors@R: person(\"Jane\", \"Doe\", role=c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),",
  "    email = \"jane@example.com\")",
  "Description: Factors have driven people to extreme measures, like ordering",
  "    custom conference ribbons and laptop stickers to express how HELLNO we",
  "    feel about stringsAsFactors. And yet, sometimes you need them. Can they",
  "    be made less maddening? Let's find out.",
  "LazyData: true"
)
writeLines(DESCRIPTION_fodder, "DESCRIPTION")
cat(DESCRIPTION_fodder, sep = "\n")
```

```{r commit-description, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = create}
add(repo, path = "DESCRIPTION")
commit(repo, message = "Edit DESCRIPTION")
```

## `use_mit_license()`

> [Pick a License, Any License. -- Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/pick-a-license-any-license/)

For foofactors, we use the MIT license. This requires specification in `DESCRIPTION` and a file called `LICENSE`. We do this now via the helper function `devtools::use_mit_license()`. Substitute your name here.

```{r use-mit-license, eval = create}
use_mit_license("Jane Doe")
```

Open the newly created `LICENSE` file and confirm it has the current year and your name.

```{r license-fodder, asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA, eval = create}
cat(readLines("LICENSE"), sep = "\n")
```

*mention LICENSE vs LICENSE.md here?*

```{r commit-license, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = create}
add(repo, path = "LICENSE")
commit(repo, message = "Add LICENSE")
```

For future projects, there is more guidance on licenses in these sources:

  * The [License section of this book](#license)
  * [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Licensing)
  * GitHub's guide at <http://choosealicense.com>

## `document()`

Wouldn't it be nice to get help on `fbind()`, just like we do with other R functions? This requires that your package have a special R documentation file, `man/fbind.Rd`, written in an R-specific markup language that is sort of like LaTeX. Luckily we don't necessarily have to author that directly.

We write a specially formatted comment right above `fbind()`, in its source file, and then let a package called [roxygen2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=roxygen2) handle the creation of `man/fbind.Rd`.  To read more about the motivation and mechanics of roxygen2, read [the documentation chapter](#man) here.

If you use RStudio, open `R/fbind.R` in the source editor and put the cursor somewhere in the `fbind()` function definition. Now do *Code > Insert roxygen skeleton*. A very special comment should appear above your function, in which each line begins with `#'`. RStudio only inserts a barebones template, so you will need to edit it to look something like that below.

If you don't use RStudio, create the comment yourself along these lines:

```{r fbind-roxygen-header, asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA, eval = create}
fbind_roxygen_header <- c(
  "#' Bind two factors",
  "#'",
  "#' Create a new factor from two existing factors, where the new factor's levels",
  "#' are the union of the levels of the input factors.",
  "#'",
  "#' @param a factor",
  "#' @param b factor",
  "#'",
  "#' @return factor",
  "#' @export",
  "#' @examples",
  "#' fbind(iris$Species[c(1, 51, 101)], PlantGrowth$group[c(1, 11, 21)])"
)
fbind_safe <- readLines(path("R", "fbind.R"))
writeLines(
  c(fbind_roxygen_header, paste(fbind_safe, collapse = "\n")),
  path("R", "fbind.R")
)
cat(fbind_roxygen_header, sep = "\n")
```

*mention how RStudio helps you execute examples here?*

```{r commit-fbind-roxygen-header, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = create}
add(repo, path = file.path("R", "fbind.R"))
commit(repo, message = "Add roxygen header to document fbind()")
```

But we're not done yet! We still need to trigger the conversion of the roxygen comment into `man/fbind.Rd`. You can do this from the RStudio IDE or from R:

  * From RStudio:
    - *Build > More > Document*
  * From R:
    - `document()`, which is a wrapper function provided by devtools.
    Under the hood, it's calling the roxygen2 package.

```{r document-fbind, eval = create}
document()
```

You should now be able to preview your help file like so:

```{r eval = FALSE}
?fbind
```

Does it show up in the usual help pane? Looking like real documentation? Isn't that exciting?

Note that your package's documentation won't be properly wired up until you do a full "Build & Reload". This polishes off niceties like the links between help files, the creation of a package index, and so on.

The RStudio [Package Development with devtools Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/devtools-cheatsheet.pdf) has good coverage of roxygen comment syntax. You can also get information from *Help > Roxygen Quick Reference*.

### `NAMESPACE` changes

In addition to converting `fbind()`'s special comment into `man/fbind.Rd`, by default, `devtools::document()` updates the `NAMESPACE` file, based on `@export` directives found in roxygen comments. Open `NAMESPACE` for inspection. It should look like so:

```{r asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA, eval = create}
cat(readLines("NAMESPACE"), sep = "\n")
```

It no longer has the placeholder content that says "export everything". Instead, there is now an explicit directive to export the `fbind()` function.

The export directive in `NAMESPACE` is what's required to "export a function" and it's what makes `fbind()` available to a user after attaching foofactors via `library(foofactors)`. Just as it is entirely possible to author `.Rd` files "by hand", you can manage `NAMESPACE` explicitly yourself. But we choose to delegate this to devtools (and roxygen2).

```{r commit-namespace, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = create}
add(repo, path = c("DESCRIPTION", "NAMESPACE", path("man", "fbind.Rd")))
commit(repo, message = "Run document()")
```

## `check()` again

foofactors should pass `R CMD check` cleanly now and forever more: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes.

```{r first-check-success, eval = create}
check()
```

## `use_testthat()`

We've tested `fbind()` informally, in a single example. We can formalize and expand this with some unit tests. This means we express a few concrete expectations about the correct `fbind()` result for various inputs.

First, we declare our intent to write unit tests and to use the testthat package for this, via `devtools::use_testthat()`:

```{r use-testthat, eval = create}
use_testthat()
```

This initializes the unit testing machinery for your package. It adds `Suggests: testthat` to `DESCRIPTION`, creates the directory `tests/testthat`, and adds the script `test/testthat.R`.

```{r commit-testthat-init, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = create}
paths <- unlist(status(repo))
add(repo, path = paths)
commit(repo, message = "Add testing infrastructure")
```

However, it's still up to YOU to write the actual tests!

The usethis package offers a helper `use_test()` to open and/or create a test file. You can provide the file basename or, if you are editing the relevant source file in RStudio, it will be automatically generated. We want to work in `tests/testthat/test_fbind.R`:

```{r test-fodder, asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA, eval = create}
test_fodder <- c(
  "context(\"Binding factors\")",
  "",
  "test_that(\"fbind binds factor (or character)\", {",
  "  x <- c(\"a\", \"b\")",
  "  x_fact <- factor(x)",
  "  y <- c(\"c\", \"d\")",
  "  z <- factor(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"))",
  "",
  "  expect_identical(fbind(x, y), z)",
  "  expect_identical(fbind(x_fact, y), z)",
  "})"
)
test_path <- path("tests", "testthat", "test_fbind.R")
writeLines(test_fodder, test_path)
cat(test_fodder, sep = "\n")
```

This tests that `fbind()` gives an expected result when combining two factors and a character vector and a factor.

```{r commit-fbind-test, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = FALSE}
paths <- unlist(status(repo))
add(repo, path = paths)
commit(repo, message = "Test fbind()")
```

Run this test interactively, as you will when you write your own. Note you'll have to load testthat via `library(testthat)` in your R session first and you'll probably want to `load_all()`.

Going forward, your tests will mostly run *en masse* and at arms's length:

  * In RStudio:
    - *Build > Test package*
  * In R:
    - `test()`, which is a convenience wrapper in devtools that calls the testthat package.

```{r test, eval = create}
test()
```

Your tests are also run whenever you `check()` the package. In this way, you basically augment the standard checks with some of your own, that are specific to your package.

For much more guidance, read the [testing chapter](#tests).

## `use_package()`

You will inevitably want to use a function from another package in your own package. Just as we needed to **export** `fbind()`, we need to **import** functions from the namespace of other packages. If you plan to submit a package to CRAN, note that this even applies to functions in packages that you think of as "always available", such as `stats::median()` or `utils::head()`.

We're going to borrow some smarts from the forcats package, specifically the function `forcats::fct_count()`, which makes a frequency table.

There is more than one way to go about this. We use the approach recommended in the [namespace chapter](#namespace). The general usage pattern is this: give the name of the external package, then two colons, then the function to call.

First, declare your general intent to use some functions from the forcats namespace with `devtools::use_package()`:

```{r use-forcats, eval = create}
use_package("forcats")
```

```{r commit-forcats-imports, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = create}
paths <- unlist(status(repo))
add(repo, path = paths)
commit(repo, message = "Import forcats")
```

This adds the forcats package to the "Imports" section of `DESCRIPTION`. And that is all.

Now we add a new function to foofactors that does, indeed, use a function from forcats. Imagine we want a frequency table for a factor, as a regular data frame with nice variable names, versus as an object of class `table` or something with odd names. Initiate a new `.R` file below `R/` with `use_r()`:

```{r init-freq-out-fake, eval = FALSE}
use_r("freq_out")
```

```{r init-freq-out, echo = FALSE, eval = create, chunk_envvar = c("TESTTHAT" = "true")}
use_r("freq_out")
```

Put this content in the file `R/freq_out.R`:

```{r freq-out-fodder, asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
freq_out_fodder <- c(
  "#' Make a sorted frequency table for a factor",
  "#'",
  "#' @param x factor",
  "#'",
  "#' @return A tibble",
  "#' @export",
  "#' @examples",
  "#' freq_out(iris$Species)",
  "freq_out <- function(x) {",
  "  forcats::fct_count(x, sort = TRUE)",
  "}"
)
cat(freq_out_fodder, sep = "\n")
```

```{r write-freq-out, include = FALSE, eval = create}
writeLines(freq_out_fodder, path("R", "freq_out_fodder.R"))
```

Notice how we preface the call to a forcats functions with `forcats::`.

```{r commit-freq-out, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = create}
paths <- unlist(status(repo))
add(repo, path = paths)
commit(repo, message = "Add freq_out()")
```

Try out the new function by simulating package installation via `load_all()`:

```{r freq-out-test-drive, eval = create}
load_all()
freq_out(iris$Species)
```

Generate the associated help file via `document()` or *Build > Document*.

```{r document-freq-out, eval = create}
document()
```

```{r commit-freq-out-rd, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = create}
paths <- unlist(status(repo))
add(repo, path = paths)
commit(repo, message = "Document freq_out()")
```

## `use_github()`

This creates a remote companion repository on GitHub, sets an upstream tracking branch for `master`, and makes an initial push. If you use RStudio, this means your Push and Pull buttons will work. If you prefer, you can always create the GitHub repo in the browser and use command line Git to add the GitHub remote and set an upstream tracking branch for `master`.

To connect to GitHub, under the hood devtools calls the GitHub API. This means you'll need to use your GitHub account to get a personal access token (PAT). This process is facilitated by `usethis::browse_github_pat()`. You'll create a PAT on GitHub and store it in the environment variable `GITHUB_PAT` in `.Renviron`.

Restart R and check that the PAT is now available:

```{r eval = FALSE}
Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")
```

You should see your PAT print to screen.

Submit the appropriate line below to use `devtools::use_github()` to connect the local foofactors Git repo to a new GitHub repo:

*currently disabled*

```{r eval = FALSE}
## public repo using https
use_github(protocol = "https")

## private repo using https
use_github(protocol = "https", private = TRUE)

## public repo using ssh
use_github()

## private repo using ssh
use_github(private = TRUE)
```

```{r use-github, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#use_github(protocol = "https")
use_github(protocol = "https", private = TRUE)
```

Go look at your package's repo on GitHub!

```{r eval = FALSE}
browse_github()
```

It should look very similar to the package created by this vignette <https://github.com/jennybc/foofactors>. If you use RStudio, your Pull and Push buttons should now work.

## `use_readme_rmd()`

Now that your package is on GitHub, the `README.md` file matters. It is the package's home page and welcome mat.

The `devtools::use_readme_rmd()` function initializes a basic, executable `README.Rmd` ready for you to edit:

```{r use-readme-rmd, eval = create, chunk_envvar = c("TESTTHAT" = "true")}
use_readme_rmd()
```

In addition to creating `README.Rmd`, this adds some lines to `.Rbuildignore`, and creates a Git pre-commit hook to help you keep `README.Rmd` and `README.md` in sync.

`README.Rmd` already has sections that:

  * Prompt you to describe the purpose of the package.
  * Provide code to install your package.
  * Prompt you to show a bit of usage.

How to populate this skeleton? Copy stuff liberally from `DESCRIPTION`, `R/foofactors-package.R`, examples, and the vignette. Anything is better than nothing. Otherwise ... do you expect people to install your package and comb through individual help files to figure out how to use it?

We write the `README` in R markdown, so it can feature actual usage. It will load the currently installed version of your package, so this is a good time to do "Build & Reload" in RStudio. Or do this in R Console:

```{r pre-readme-install, eval = create}
install()
```

If RStudio has not already done so, open `README.Rmd` for editing. Make sure it shows some usage of `fbind()` and/or `freq_out()`, for example.

```{r commit-readme-rmd, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = create}
paths <- unlist(status(repo))
add(repo, path = paths)
commit(repo, message = "Set up README.Rmd")
```

The `README.Rmd` we use can be seen here: [README.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/foofactors/master/README.Rmd).

```{r copy-readme-rmd, include = debug, eval = create}
file_copy(
  path(owd, "fixtures", "foofactors-README.Rmd"),
  "README.Rmd",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

```{r cat-readme-rmd, asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA, eval = create}
cat(readLines("README.Rmd"), sep = "\n")
```

Don't forget to render it to make `README.md`! The pre-commit hook should remind you if you try to commit `README.Rmd` but not `README.md` and also when `README.md` appears to be out-of-date.

```{r eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd") ## or use "Knit HTML"
```

```{r render-readme-rmd, include = debug, eval = create}
callr::r(
  function(.input) rmarkdown::render(input = .input, quiet = TRUE),
  args = list(.input = "README.Rmd")
)
```

You can see the rendered `README.md` simply by [visiting foofactors on GitHub](https://github.com/jennybc/foofactors#readme).

Finally, don't forget to do one last commit. And push!

```{r commit-rendered-readme, echo = debug, comment = NA, eval = create}
paths <- unlist(status(repo))
add(repo, path = paths)
commit(repo, message = "Write README.Rmd and render")
```

```{r final-push, include = debug, eval = FALSE}
push(repo, credentials = cred_user_pass("EMAIL", Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")))
## if tags become useful, here's how to push one
## push(repo, "origin", "refs/tags/fbind-init",
##      credentials = cred_user_pass("EMAIL", Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")))
## not clear if git2r has easy way to push all tags
## https://github.com/ropensci/git2r/issues/265
```

## The End

Let's run `check()` again to make sure all is still well.

```{r final-check, eval = create}
check()
```

foofactors should have no errors, warnings or notes. This would be a good time to do "Build and reload" to celebrate.

```{r final-install, eval = create}
install()
```

Feel free to visit the [foofactors package](https://github.com/jennybc/foofactors) on GitHub, which is exactly as developed in this vignette. The commit history reflects each individual step, so use the diffs to see the addition and modification of files, as the package evolved.

```{r teardown, include = debug, eval = create}
remove.packages("foofactors")
```
